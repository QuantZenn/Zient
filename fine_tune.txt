GOAL: this would be to finetune Zient-Core, which would be good for simple statemnt sentiments. 
- I would hope to finetune for specific ticker, this way we can read news articles or statements, live,
  then asses how the news would impacat the price in the coming, minutes, hours, and closing.
- Since, Zient-Core would be great at giving an inital statments and confidence, maybe the goal of this model -
  would be a project impact in the direction, of the initail sentiment and cofidence or a well crafted final 
  confidence and sentiment.
- live model woould be different as we can only feed few datas live, but hope to predicted the future
- the goal would b to have a market sentiment tracker where we can take in news calculate or do llm to determine,
  the market sentiment of the direction it will go long, term, short term
- maybe using the impacted score to adjusted the final senitment and confidence level, 
  this way we can finetune how a ticker could respond to specific news and types,
  and a more accurate views of predictions on how they should repsonds to certain news 
- or we can show how previous news have affected the stock and then further teain with all the data nalaysis to more or fine tune 
  for beter accuractly and confidences
