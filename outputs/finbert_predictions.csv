Dorel Reports Third Quarter 2022 Results MONTREAL Nov. 04 2022 GLOBE NEWSWIRE Dorel Industries Inc. TSX DII.B DII.A today announced results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30 2022.hird quarter revenue was US$374.1 million down 14.4% from US$437.2 million last year. Reported net loss from continuing operations was US$36.7 million or US$1.13 per diluted share compared to US$68.0 million or US$2.09 per diluted share last year. Adjusted net loss1 from continuing operations was US$34.7 million or US$1.07 per diluted share compared to US$66.8 million or US$2.06 per diluted share a year ago. Last yearthird quarter loss included US$61.7 million or US$1.90 per diluted share as the result of an unfavourable tax assessment.Nine month revenue from continuing operations was US$1.23 billion a decrease of 7.1% compared to US$1.32llion last year. Reported net loss from continuing operations year to date was US$77.6 million or US$2.38 per diluted share compared to US$82.2 million or US$2.53 per diluted share in 2021. Nine month adjusted net loss1 from continuing operations was US$71.2 million or US$2.19 per diluted share compared to US$70.8 million or US$2.18 per diluted share a year ago. was a difficult quarter as we saw a significant drop in orders from our U.S. brick and mortar retail partners. These customers are reacting to the overall negative economic environment and poor consumer sentiment by focusing on reducing their in store inventory levels across many product categories including ours. We are also carrying excess inventories as the supply chain bottlenecks have eased resulting in a considerable influx of merchandise as we entered the third quarter. At Dorel Home this situation started in the second quarter and we responded with promotional activities in an effort to reduce inventory. The drop in orders at Dorel Juvenile in the U.S. was much more than we expected after what was a tremendous second quarter. This coupled with the U.S. dollar strengthening even more in the third quarter were the two biggest drivers of our underperformance. Further consumers in Europe are much more cautious due to the continued instability abroad and the particularly acute fall in the value of the Euro and Pound Sterling. As we move forward our focus for the balance of the year will be to drive sales to reduce inventories and generate cash to prepare for 2023 where we anticipate lower input costs and a return to more normal ordering levelsstated Dorel President & CEO Martin Schwartz.,negative,negative,0.9722

Reported net loss from continuing operations was US$36.7 million or US$1.13 per diluted share, compared to US$68.0 million or US$2.09 per diluted share last year. Adjusted net loss1 from continuing operations was US$34.7 million or US$1.07 per diluted share, compared to US$66.8 million or US$2.06 per diluted share a year ago. Last year?셲 third quarter loss included US$61.7 million, or US$1.90 per diluted share as the result of an unfavourable tax assessment.Nine-month revenue from continuing operations was US$1.23 billion, a decrease of 7.1% compared to US$1.32?칋illion last year. Reported net loss from continuing operations year-to-date was US$77.6 million or US$2.38 per diluted share, compared to US$82.2 million or US$2.53 per diluted share in 2021. Nine-month adjusted net loss1 from continuing operations was US$71.2 million or US$2.19 per diluted share, compared to US$70.8 million or US$2.18 per diluted share a year ago.혻혻?쏧t was a difficult quarter as we saw a significant drop in orders from our U.S. brick and mortar retail partners. These customers are reacting to the overall negative economic environment and poor consumer sentiment by focusing on reducing their in-store inventory levels across many product categories, including ours. We are also carrying excess inventories as the supply chain bottlenecks have eased, resulting in a considerable influx of merchandise as we entered the third quarter. At Dorel Home, this situation started in the second quarter and we responded with promotional activities in an effort to reduce inventory. The drop in orders at Dorel Juvenile in the U.S. was much more than we expected, after what was a tremendous second quarter. This coupled with the U.S. dollar strengthening even more in the third quarter were the two biggest drivers of our underperformance. Further, consumers in Europe are much more cautious due to the continued instability abroad and the particularly acute fall in the value of the Euro and Pound Sterling. As we move forward, our focus for the balance of the year will be to drive sales to reduce inventories and generate cash to prepare for 2023 where we anticipate lower input costs and a return to more normal ordering levels,??stated Dorel President & CEO, Martin Schwartz.혻혻",negative,negative,0.9719

Adjusted net loss1 from continuing operations was US$34.7 million or US$1.07 per diluted share, compared to US$66.8 million or US$2.06 per diluted share a year ago. Last year???third quarter loss included US$61.7 million, or US$1.90 per diluted share as the result of an unfavourable tax assessment.Nine-month revenue from continuing operations was US$1.23 billion, a decrease of 7.1% compared to US$1.32?移땓llion last year.

These customers are reacting to the overall negative economic environment and poor consumer sentiment by focusing on reducing their in-store inventory levels across many product categories, including ours. We are also carrying excess inventories as the supply chain bottlenecks have eased, resulting in a considerable influx of merchandise as we entered the third quarter. At Dorel Home, this situation started in the second quarter and we responded with promotional activities in an effort to reduce inventory. The drop in orders at Dorel Juvenile in the U.S. was much more than we expected, after what was a tremendous second quarter. This coupled with the U.S. dollar strengthening even more in the third quarter were the two biggest drivers of our underperformance. Further, consumers in Europe are much more cautious due to the continued instability abroad and the particularly acute fall in the value of the Euro and Pound Sterling. As we move forward, our focus for the balance of the year will be to drive sales to reduce inventories and generate cash to prepare for 2023 where we anticipate lower input costs and a return to more normal ordering levels,??stated Dorel President & CEO, Martin Schwartz.?삵샍",negative,negative,0.9734

Reported net loss from continuing operations was US$36.7 million or US$1.13 per diluted share, compared to US$68.0 million or US$2.09 per diluted share last year. Adjusted net loss1 from continuing operations was US$34.7 million or US$1.07 per diluted share, compared to US$66.8 million or US$2.06 per diluted share a year ago. Last year???third quarter loss included US$61.7 million, or US$1.90 per diluted share as the result of an unfavourable tax assessment.Nine-month revenue from continuing operations was US$1.23 billion, a decrease of 7.1% compared to US$1.32?移땓llion last year. Reported net loss from continuing operations year-to-date was US$77.6 million or US$2.38 per diluted share, compared to US$82.2 million or US$2.53 per diluted share in 2021. Nine-month adjusted net loss1 from continuing operations was US$71.2 million or US$2.19 per diluted share, compared to US$70.8 million or US$2.18 per diluted share a year ago.?삵샍??쬽 was a difficult quarter as we saw a significant drop in orders from our U.S. brick and mortar retail partners. These customers are reacting to the overall negative economic environment and poor consumer sentiment by focusing on reducing their in-store inventory levels across many product categories, including ours. We are also carrying excess inventories as the supply chain bottlenecks have eased, resulting in a considerable influx of merchandise as we entered the third quarter. At Dorel Home, this situation started in the second quarter and we responded with promotional activities in an effort to reduce inventory. The drop in orders at Dorel Juvenile in the U.S. was much more than we expected, after what was a tremendous second quarter. This coupled with the U.S. dollar strengthening even more in the third quarter were the two biggest drivers of our underperformance. Further, consumers in Europe are much more cautious due to the continued instability abroad and the particularly acute fall in the value of the Euro and Pound Sterling. As we move forward, our focus for the balance of the year will be to drive sales to reduce inventories and generate cash to prepare for 2023 where we anticipate lower input costs and a return to more normal ordering levels,??stated Dorel President & CEO, Martin Schwartz.?삵샍",negative,negative,0.9734

These customers are reacting to the overall negative economic environment and poor consumer sentiment by focusing on reducing their in-store inventory levels across many product categories, including ours. We are also carrying excess inventories as the supply chain bottlenecks have eased, resulting in a considerable influx of merchandise as we entered the third quarter. At Dorel Home, this situation started in the second quarter and we responded with promotional activities in an effort to reduce inventory. The drop in orders at Dorel Juvenile in the U.S. was much more than we expected, after what was a tremendous second quarter. This coupled with the U.S. dollar strengthening even more in the third quarter were the two biggest drivers of our underperformance. Further, consumers in Europe are much more cautious due to the continued instability abroad and the particularly acute fall in the value of the Euro and Pound Sterling. As we move forward, our focus for the balance of the year will be to drive sales to reduce inventories and generate cash to prepare for 2023 where we anticipate lower input costs and a return to more normal ordering levels,??stated Dorel President & CEO, Martin Schwartz.?삵샍",negative,negative,0.9734

Similar to the first hole (see Azucar release dated May 27, 2022), the second hole in this area (EC-22-115) passed through typical clay dominant lithocap alteration into phyllic alteration. Large intervals of brecciated rock were intersected possibly reflecting a diatreme like body that may have disrupted any earlier porphyry alteration zonation in this area. Alteration data has been collected from the core using a Terraspec infrared spectrometer along with samples for assay and fluid inclusion analysis. Any future drilling in this area will be guided by the results and interpretation of these analyses from both holes. The drill rig has been demobilised from the pad where these two holes were drilled as any future drilling to test this lithocap target will need to be conducted in other accessible portions of this very large area.",negative,neutral,0.916
